## Core Concept
Supply and Demand trading identifies zones where institutional orders create significant price reactions. These zones represent areas where price is likely to reverse or show strong reactions due to accumulated orders.

## Zone Identification
1. Supply Zones:
   - Areas of heavy selling pressure

   - Clear price rejection
   - Usually marked by bearish candles

   - Areas of heavy buying pressure
   - Strong bullish moves from zone
   - Clear price support
   - Usually marked by bullish candles

## Technical Requirements
1. Order Block Identification:
   - Last significant candle before major move
   - Clear price rejection
   - Strong momentum from zone
   - Clean market structure

2. Zone Characteristics:
   - Sharp price departure
